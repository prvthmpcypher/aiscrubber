## 🔍 What is AiScrubber?

AiScrubber is a **browser-based privacy gateway** that detects and masks Personally Identifiable Information (PII) directly on your device — before your text is ever submitted to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any other public LLM.

No server. No account. No tracking. Your data never leaves your browser.

Built solo by **[Poorvith M P](https://github.com/prvthmpcypher)**.

## 🎯 The Problem

| Risk | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| 🕵️ **Corporate Espionage** | Public AI models train on user inputs. Pasting proprietary code or strategy docs surrenders your IP permanently. |
| ⚖️ **Regulatory Breach** | Submitting unredacted patient data (HIPAA) or attorney-client communications through AI tools invites severe legal penalties. |
| 🔓 **Data Leakage** | Emails, phone numbers, SSNs, and IDs pasted into prompts are logged, stored, and potentially exposed. |

---

## ✅ The Solution

```
Paste raw text → AiScrubber detects PII → Replaces with safe placeholders → You copy clean output → Paste into any AI safely
```

Everything happens **in your browser RAM.** Nothing is sent anywhere.

---

## ⚡ Features

- 🔒 **Local-only processing** — Zero server round-trips. Ever.
- 🧠 **PII Detection Engine** — Regex-based detection of emails, phone numbers, IDs, and more
- 🏷️ **Smart Placeholder System** — Replaces sensitive data with tokens like `EMAIL_1`, `PHONE_2`
- 🗝️ **Encrypted Vault Export** — Password-protected keymap to reverse masking when needed
- 📄 **Multi-format Export** — Download sanitized output as TXT, DOC, PDF, or encrypted vault PDF
- ♻️ **Session Recovery** — Accidental tab close? Your last workspace is auto-recovered via `localStorage`
- 🌑 **Dark-first UI** — Clean, distraction-free workspace built for professionals
- 💸 **Free forever** — No account, no paywall, no ads
